# SimpleGuiQuizGen
A simple quiz generator with a lot of user interaction
By the end of the project we will have two functioning gui's

1. The entering questions for the quiz GUI with 4 Answer Boxes and 1 Question Box as well as a number of buttons: Complete, Restart, Next Question and End/Cancel. This will store a number of questions in a question bank.
2. A secondary GUI for which will run through all questions in question bank and allow users to click answers and keep score/say if correct with a Restart and Back button.
